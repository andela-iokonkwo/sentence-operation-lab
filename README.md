#Sentence Lab

+ Have the prototype function `LetterChanges()` take the str parameter being passed to `new Operation(str)` and modify it using the following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string.

+ Have the prototype function `LetterCapitalize()` take the str parameter being passed to `new Operation(str)` and capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space.

+ Have the function `LongestWord()` take the str parameter being passed to `new Operation(str)` and return the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume str will not be empty.



## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\generic.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
